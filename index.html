<blockquote>
  An Euler path is a path that uses every edge in a graph with no repeats. Being a path, it does not have to return to the starting vertex.
</blockquote>
<pre>
  stack St;
put start vertex in St;
until St is empty
  let V be the value at the top of St;
  if degree(V) = 0, then
    add V to the answer;
    remove V from the top of St;
  otherwise
    find any edge coming out of V;
    remove it from the graph;
    put the second end of this edge in St;
